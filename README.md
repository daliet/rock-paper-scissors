# Rock - Paper - Scissors project

This is my solution to the first javascript project of The Odin 
Project curriculum. 
[Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) you can find more information about the project.

# Instructions

This game is played in the browser console. There is a prompt message 
that asks the user for input (rock, paper or scissors). An alert message 
reports the winner of each round and after 5 rounds it 
reports the final score and result.
